    "# Welcome to Minerva Fashion Mnist problem\n",
    "\n",
    "CHECK THE VIDEO [![Minerva welcome video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bI-YlVJJl-I/2.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-YlVJJl-I&feature=youtu.be)\n",
    "\n",
    "Minerva is a platform that lets you learn real life data science at your own pace, piece by piece, feature at a time.\n",
    "We re-implement solutions to the most difficult data scientific problems so that you can learn how to do that too.\n",
    "Every problem is a collection of small, digestable tasks. Every task is a piece of code, a step in a large machine learning pipeline. You just need to create your implementation!\n",
    "\n",
    "We know what the final score for a well implemented pipeline should be. So as you solve tasks and re-implement parts of the pipeline we will be checking whether your implementation does the job well enough to keep the score high. So beware, we are watching :)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "This project assumes `python 3`.\n",
    "The rest of the requirements can be installed via:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use neptune monitoring please login via\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune login\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you are logged in create a project called Minerva. If you want to choose a different name go remember to change the project key in the neptune_config.yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "# How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run your pipeline to make sure that everything is working correctly:\n",
    "If you want to run it on cloud go\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config neptune_config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- dry_run\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you want to run it locally but you want to visualize your results with neptune go\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run minerva.py -- dry_run\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you really like those console logs use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py dry_run\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Choose a task for example `task1.ipynb` or `task1.py' if you don't like notebooks\n",
    "Write your implementation to the task by filling the body of the solution function and CONFIG dictionary according to the instructions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CONFIG = {}\n",
    "def solution():\n",
    "    return something\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Submit your solution by running one of three options:\n",
    "Run on cloud:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config neptune_config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- submit --task_nr 1 --filepath user_solution/notebooks/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run locally with neptune monitoring:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run minerva.py -- submit --task_nr 1 --filepath user_solution/notebooks/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run pure python:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py submit --task_nr 1 --filepath user_solution/notebooks/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Wait for the results in the command line\n",
